# Data Structures
A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.


- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Queue
- Stack
- Hash Table
- Heap - max and min heap versions
- Priority Queue
- Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree
- Graph (both directed and undirected)


# Algorithms
An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.
